# Gamma of Night Lights
Control luminance, moonlight and sunlight intensity, fog density and day/night length

## Features
* Control luminance at nighttime, daytime, morning and evening
* Control fog density (ambient , make some changes to realize what's that exactly)
* Control luminance and fog density at indoors (that mean instanced locations like crypts, caves and so on)
* Control moonlight and sunlight intensity (less luminance and more moonlight makes night more realistic, moonlit swamp looks terrific)
* Control night length in percents of all day length (like to make nights shorter but darker)
* Control day length in seconds (entire day length in seconds, vanilla 1800 sec)
* Sky is still visible but it does not provide a light (starry sky at dark nights is just gorgeous)
* Configuration is server-synced

Night length control is not just brightness control but actual day and night routine. It doesn't interfere with overall day length but changing the proportions of day/night cycle. It DOES mean more dangerous creatures at set long nights.
