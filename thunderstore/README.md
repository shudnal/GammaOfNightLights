# Gamma of Night Lights
Control luminance, moonlight and sunlight intensity, fog density and day/night cycle

## Features
* Control luminance at night
* Conrol luminance during the day in dark environments (marked as always dark like Rain, Thunderstorm, LightRain, Eikthyr, Swamp and so)
* Exclude dungeons from luminance control (in case you want everything to be darker except indoors)
* Control moonlight and sunlight intensity cause why not (moonlit swamp looks terrific)
* Control fog density cause why not (what if you dislike or enjoy the fog)
* And at last control night length (like to make nights shorter but darker)
* Configuration is server-synced

Night length control is not just brightness control but actual day and night routine. It doesn't interfere with overall day length of 1800 seconds but changing the proportions of day/night cycle. It DOES mean more dangerous creatures at set long nights.

## Installation (manual)
extract GammaOfNightLights.dll file to your BepInEx\Plugins\ folder

## Known issues
* Mod should be compatible with any mod depends on day night cycle and any environment mod
